# BasicTabularRL

A hands-on explanation of basic tabular methods in reinforcement learning. 

#Â Objective

We cover the basic ideas and develop the core theory of temporal difference methods of SARSA and Q-learning.

# Key concepts

In this presentation we explain how we can analyze reinforcement learning as the combination of:

* Estimating long-term reward, 
* Correcting estimation error, and 
* Balancing exploit vs. explore.

We also explain the temporal difference methods SARSA and Q-learning.
